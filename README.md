This is a repo with all my linux configuration files. It is formatted for usage with GNU stow. If you don't know what that is I highly recommend checking out Chris@machine's video on it. I do not claim any of the code as my own. I simply modified these files to my liking for personal use, however anyone is welcome to use this.
